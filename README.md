# advent-of-code-2019

## What is AoC?
Advent of Code (AoC) is an advent calendar for programmers, where each day of December you are provided with a new problem to solve with a language of your choice. Each year has a fantastic plot and story line you can follow along with as you solve each days challenge.

## Who makes Advent of Code?
Each year [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/) and a small team go about creating an event that is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of enthusiasts around the globe. You can find out more about it on the [AoC Website](https://adventofcode.com/about)

## What is ZTM's involvement?
Whilst AoC provide an official leaderboard, we thought it would be awesome to have a collection hub and leaderboard for all solutions created by members of the Zero To Mastery community. A central location where you can view solutions from other members, add your own solutions, give some love to your favourite solutions and of course see how you rank against other members of the community.

## Can I join in?
Everyone is encouraged to participate, it's a fantastic opportunity to learn, practice and expand your knowledge and skill set. It's also a huge amount of fun.

## What languages can I use?
You are free to use whichever language you feel would be best suited to the problem at hand. You are also welcome to submit multiple solutions in different languages.
